IDEAS:

Vertex:
-Hashtable to represent vertex object
  -> Hashtable key is object
  -> Hashtable value DList representing the adjacencyList
  -> Each node in adjacency list contains ITEM which is the VertexPair representing the edge
  -> Edges in DList are represented by VertexPair objects

Edges:
-Hashtable to represent edge objects
  -> Edge key is VertexPair
  -> Edge value is weight
  -> VertexPair contains references to the nodes in each vertex adjacency list
