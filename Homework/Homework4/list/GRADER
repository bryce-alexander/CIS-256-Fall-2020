An application can inadvertently violate invariants in a few ways as listed below:
- Call insertFront/insertBack(null) will insert a null node into the list and cause nodes referencing it to return
  null in the method calls
- Call prev/next(node) for the first/last node in the array and .next will return null.

It is worth noting that while these methods have the outward appearance of violating the invariants to the user, they
may remain intact from a functional level if you actually inspect the elements and their connections directly
from an application within the package who can access protected fields.
