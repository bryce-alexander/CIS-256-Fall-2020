Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  My mergesort is stable because, in mergeSortedQueues(), if a size-two queue with the same keys is compared,
  the first key remains in the first position.  Only if the first item is smaller will it be switched to the
  end of the queue.

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  My quicksort is not stable because, even though items are added in the order they are encountered during pivot(),
  the randomly selected pivot value is not necessarily the first item that holds that value in the queue.
