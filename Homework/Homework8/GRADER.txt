Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  My mergesort is not stable because, in mergeSortedQueues(), if a size-two queue with the same keys is compared,
  the second key gets switched for the first.  (If index one is smaller, it will remain as index one, otherwise
  index two will be placed in front of it).

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?

  My quicksort is stable because it walks down the queue from the first key and adds equal values to the qEquals
  queue in the order they are encountered.
